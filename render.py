    Args:
      H: int. Height of image in pixels.
      W: int. Width of image in pixels.
      focal: float. Focal length of pinhole camera.
      chunk: int. Maximum number of rays to process simultaneously. Used to
        control maximum memory usage. Does not affect final results.
      rays: array of shape [2, batch_size, 3]. Ray origin and direction for
        each example in batch.
      c2w: array of shape [3, 4]. Camera-to-world transformation matrix.
      ndc: bool. If True, represent ray origin, direction in NDC coordinates.
      near: float or array of shape [batch_size]. Nearest distance for a ray.
      far: float or array of shape [batch_size]. Farthest distance for a ray.
      use_viewdirs: bool. If True, use viewing direction of a point in space in model.
      c2w_staticcam: array of shape [3, 4]. If not None, use this transformation matrix for 
       camera while using other c2w argument for viewing directions.
    Returns:
      rgb_map: [batch_size, 3]. Predicted RGB values for rays.
      disp_map: [batch_size]. Disparity map. Inverse of depth.
      acc_map: [batch_size]. Accumulated opacity (alpha) along a ray.
      extras: dict with everything returned by render_rays().
